# Tic-tac-toe
This was a step up ! I struggled so much i thinkn i might take a break from the lessons and
focus myself on understanding scope, closure and deisgn patterns more.
I could only achieve this one thanks to the article provided in the lesson. I would have never
made it without this. I learned a lot about what i don't know and how to build up the logic of a webgame
interface tho and this is good. I hope i can feel comfortable about all this soon.
